### Changelog
#### 0.1.7 (More Stuff Update)
* Fixed how saving throws work to fit core SWN usage and added the option to use SWN 1e saving throw rules.
* Refined how the saving throw function compares two attributes.
* Removed showSaveModType from the settings because it wasn't necessary.
* Level and XP fields added.
* Tech saves added, since I remembered those are a thing in the original SWN.
* Added the appropriate Notes textfields. Now includes Notes to Remember / Allies / Enemies along with an "Other" field at the bottom.
* Skills buttons added, but not actually working yet. Still planning on how I want to do the Skills page.

#### 0.1.6 (I'm An Idiot Update)
* Fixed the template file preventing the game from being loaded because of a couple of typos.

#### 0.1.5 (Insert Character Here Update)
* Changed template files from .html to .hbs (mostly so that my text editor properly handles Handlebar styling)
* Chat cards for saving throw rolls now use "<Saving Throw> Save"
* Various styling additions.
* Modified the sheet tabs. Now includes Bio / Notes / Equipment [That includes weapons and defense rolls] / Skills / Foci / Psionics / Settings
* Added a bunch of character fields, since those are a little important. Bio mostly filled out, and the others I'll work on later.

#### 0.1.4 (How Do Ability Scores Work? Update)
* Attribute scores now auto-generate.
* Saving throws now add their proper modifiers when rolled.
* Added CHANGELOG.md to make sure the README doesn't get too filled up.
* Added a section for future contributors and a few links to my personal stuff.
* Also found out that setting "type='button'" on buttons fixes the "sheet rolling the first button it finds" in some browsers issue. Good to know.
