Stars Without Number system for FoundryVTT, compatible for all editions and with a multitude of options for running the game!

### Developer Notes
If you'd like to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant), I retweet mostly tabletop stuff and cool art over there and will occasionally post updates about things I'm working on. Additionally I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thalissa) if you'd like to support me!

### Contributors
Those that assist in contributing to the project will be listed here! Though I expect no help, if anyone provides any assistance I'll be more than happy to pull code in.

### Changelog
#### 0.1.6 (I'm An Idiot Update)
* Fixed the template file preventing the game from being loaded because of a couple of typos.

#### 0.1.5 (Insert Character Here Update)
* Changed template files from .html to .hbs (mostly so that my text editor properly handles Handlebar styling)
* Chat cards for saving throw rolls now use "<Saving Throw> Save"
* Various styling additions.
* Modified the sheet tabs. Now includes Bio / Notes / Equipment [That includes weapons and defense rolls] / Skills / Foci / Psionics / Settings
* Added a bunch of character fields, since those are a little important. Bio mostly filled out, and the others I'll work on later.

#### 0.1.4 (How Do Ability Scores Work? Update)
* Attribute scores now auto-generate.
* Saving throws now add their proper modifiers when rolled.
* Added CHANGELOG.md to make sure the README doesn't get too filled up.
* Added a section for future contributors and a few links to my personal stuff.
* Also found out that setting "type='button'" on buttons fixes the "sheet rolling the first button it finds" in some browsers issue. Good to know.

#### 0.1.3 (Unified Sheets Update)
* Shoved all of the sheet functions into their own file so I can share them consistently between the player and NPC sheets.
