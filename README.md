## Stars Without Number
Stars Without Number system for FoundryVTT, compatible for all editions and with a multitude of options for running the game!

### Changeling
#### 0.1.0 (Beginner System Developer Update)
* Very, very basics, modified from the publicly available [Simple Worldbuilding](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding/) system for my own usage.
* There already exists a Stars Without Number, but in the name of diversity, learning and personal preference I've decided to make my own from scratch as a conscious decision rather than modify the existing one. While this means that mine will be incomplete for a while, I hope to one day ensure that everyone can run a Stars Without Number game however they like. Until then, if you'd like a more complete system, please check out [Stars Without Number: Revised](https://github.com/Spice-King/foundry-swnr/) system.
* There's a big to-do list. But first course of action is getting actor sheets working, and then getting them presentable. That's not included in this update, but the character sheets *exist* at the very least.
